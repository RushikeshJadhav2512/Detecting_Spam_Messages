# Spam_Detector
Spam Message Detection Model Overview This machine learning model is designed to detect spam messages in text data. It's built using natural language processing techniques and a classification algorithm to identify whether a message is likely to be spam or not. The model has been trained on a dataset of labeled messages to learn patterns and characteristics of spam messages.

Model Details Model Type: Classification Algorithm Used: Multinomial Naive Bayes Feature Extraction: Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer) Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score Usage Installation This project uses Python and several libraries, including Scikit-learn. Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt. Training the Model The model training code is available in the train_model.ipynb notebook. It utilizes a dataset of labeled messages (spam and non-spam) for training and evaluating the model. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the model on your dataset. Using the Trained Model Once trained, the model can be used to predict whether a message is spam or not. Use the predict.py script by passing the message as an argument to get a prediction. File Descriptions train_model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the model. predict.py: Python script to make predictions using the trained model. requirements.txt: List of dependencies and required libraries. Dataset The model was trained on a publicly available SMS Spam Collection dataset. The dataset contains labeled messages categorized as spam or non-spam.
